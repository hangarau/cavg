# cavg

A cli tool that allows you to take averages of colours. See [the Documentation](Documentation.md) for usage.

If you're building, the Makefile assumes you're on Linux and have `mingw-w64` installed. 

In case you're wondering how to say "cavg", there is no right way. Personally I say "see-av" and just leave the "g" out, but it's up to you. The **C** in the name may stand for **C**olour or the **C** language. I will not tell you which one.
